Deliverable 3 Module 7

# Overview
Pewlett-Hackard will be undergoing major changes given the number of employees that are due to retire in the coming years. We are helping Pewlett-Hackard brace for the “silver tsunami”. 
## Objectives
There were two objectives given to us by Bobby’s manager: determine the number of retiring employees per title and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program.

# Results
## Deliverable 1
•	The unique_titles table in deliverable 1 seen here:


•	Returned a list of 72,458 employees. These individuals met two criterions: they began working at Pewlett_Hackard after 01/01/1999, and they were born between 01/01/1952 and 12/31/1955.
•	Seen below is retiring_titles table:



•	This table displayed how many jobs were going to need to be replaced by role in the company.
## Deliverable 2
•	The mentorship_eligibility table is seen below:


 
•	This query was written to create a table for current employees born between 01/01/1965 abd 12/31/1965



# Summary
•	How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact? 72,458 see unique_titles table.
•	Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees? Yes, there are certainly enough qualified mentors for the next couple of years. The real burden will be the cost of training to replace these retirees. Essentially, paying two salaries to perform one job.
